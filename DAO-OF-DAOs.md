### Notes on A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) of DAOs

*Not Yet Complete, [See Here](#bottom).*

> "Additional use cases of DAOs include financial transactions, secure voting, autonomous organizations, company management, freedom of speech networks, online games, crowdfunding, and speculation, among many other possible applications that cannot be foreseen."

Good to reference to provide use cases to newcomers.

> "Other networks are developing upgrades to blockchains that enhance smart contracting and associated DAO features."

Although 'other networks' are not specified, anybody coming from the ETH platform will likely be concerned with the platforms long term viability. Information for more 'serious individuals could be provided (as well as used for marketing materials) regarding the advantages of using a eUTxO chain for dApp development, or simply for dApp usage (gas fees, etc). Using this quote as a reference highlights the requirement to migrate from ETH.

See the following quote:

> "The limitations of the Ethereum platform, such as transaction throughput and gas fees, are creating a need for next-generation blockchain technology and smart contracts. DAOs help facilitate this evolution."

Welcome, ADAO, right?

> "The concept of a DAO fails if it becomes centralized. Centralization is omnipresent in computing systems, economics, and society at large. Yet centralization in governance is perhaps the largest threat to a DAO. With increasing centralization comes increasing risk of an organization's unifying principles changing or being ignored over time. Decentralization forces the shared understanding and shared social contract to be of primary importance for the life of the organization."

This does highlight the importance of decentralisation, however, it is quite abstract in its nature. Perhaps a concrete example may help? For instance:

In addition, something a little more related to finance, during the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis, internal audits at AIG were con

> "In 2007, AIG's auditors raised warnings. One of them, Joseph St.Denis, resigned in protest after Cassano repeatedly blocked him from investigating AIGFP's accounting."

It should be theoretically impossible to block the auditing (supervision) of DAOs:

> "Community audits are a key element in DAO governance. Centralized systems rarely provide for and administer community-driven audits. Community-driven audits go against the agency and monitoring principles embedded in the centralized governance."

One thought I have is: "who watches the watchman?" — hypothetically could an audit DAO be convinsed to provide 'AAA'-esque audit ratings to code in one form or another?

> "Tying the legal existence of a DAO to any forms of existing legal and jurisdictional frameworks typically results in the need for a representative in the chosen legal framework and jurisdiction, which, in turn, centralizes the DAO and results in the failure of the DAO concept."

Given that legal frameworks exist in all jurisdictions, assuming this statement holds true, how exactly is one suppose to effectively become a DAO & maintain decentralisation?

Some great quotes to come, but I will play devils advocate.

> "With only a limited ability to influence the direction of product/technology development, the developer community is less able to deploy its unique talents and skills in creating technology solutions for the greater good of humanity."

> "In other words, if the developer community does not receive the support it needs in developing decentralized infrastructure solutions, society at large suffers."

Motivation for asking this question is based on instances of so-called ‘exit-scams’ where an exchange (or some organisation) such as Intersango[1] or Mt.Gox[2] has (through malicious intent or otherwise) lost all of, or part of their organisations ‘treasury’. It’s either been stolen (purposefully) or has been lost through incompetence. Furthermore, we’ve seen similar behaviour at a collective level within much larger organisations (during 2007 — 2008 financial crisis) — financial institutions, rating agencies, governments, insurance companies, etc. How likely (or possible) is it for corruption to occur within a DAO?

<hr />

**Thoughts, general notes:** Currently, we’re operating in a fairly unregulated space. In addition, assuming we believe that "if the developer community does not receive the support it needs in developing decentralized infrastructure solutions, society at large suffers", it could be argued that a similar sentiment was echoed by Larry Summers when commenting on 'Has Finance Made the World Riskier?'[3], which I think is, at minimum, an interesting comparison to draw. He was essentially fighting against what he (and others) thought was over-reaching legislation.

'Has Finance Made the World Riskier?' focuses on incentive structures, which happens to be a key component within any DAO. From the perspective of fiduciary responsibility, if an entity provides tools for another (possibly nefarious DAO, or DAOs that intends to switch from being collectively invested to personally invested) DAO and that DAO fails, where does the accountability (or legal guilt) lay?

*An example (bear in mind, this is my first week really diving fairly deep & learning about these structures, perhaps I have misunderstood some technical details):*

Let’s assume some DAO uses tooling provided by an entity and implements reputation based staking that utilises NFT-Based Reputation Identifiers as a means of weighting each vote cast (as appose to other voting based mechanisms, such as one token one vote). Given the set of DAO members, would it be possible for a subset of those members to 'turn rogue', sell their Reputation Identifiers to a third party and cause a catastrophic failure of the DAO?

Is this possible given the design constraints that have been currently considered?

> "DAOs have the potential to form the foundation for technology development that serves the greater good of society."

Great quote, the next question raised by a newcomer is likely to be: 'why?'.

> "At the beginning of the 2020s, DAOs are still subject to significant limitations. Such limitations include path dependencies, regulatory uncertainty, lingering suboptimal incentive designs, public policy, as well as market, economic, and technical limitations, among others."

General question: how far have we come since 2020? Are we maintaining 'Conceptual Design Debt'?

**There is a lot of information on Regulatory Uncertainty - however, I am under the impression that some of the American laws regarding tax, etc - are pretty wild & I don't really know enough about them to comment.**

However, this is a consideration that has certainly been made.

> "Human nature and any effective machine derivatives of human engagements in institutional form require a duality of incentives in order to overcome attempts of rational and opportunistic internal and external constituents to game the governance design of a given DAO. The duality of incentives consists of a) incentives for actors to improve their own utility, while at the same time b) actors’ actions benefit the entirety of the institution and its constituents for the long run."

* The notion of 'duality of incentives' is really interesting.
* I consider (or interpret) this somewhat to translate to Successful DAOs offer incentive structures that promote lifestyles of autonomy, self-mastery and collective purpose [4].
* I think this is a great 'sell' to anyone considering joining.

### Path Dependencies

> The original DAO has a lasting impact on emerging DAO designs. It created core commonalities and associated path dependencies in future generations of DAOs. The core common denominator for all DAO token members is the unifying desire to optimise the DAO token value. Accordingly, performance assessment in the DAO structure is based on value optimisation, not on hierarchical or political processes. On the upside, token holders and contractors work towards a common goal of optimising the DAO and the token value and non-performance repetitional penalties are free from racial or cultural biases and associated implications as the token holders are unlikely to even know each other. Yet, the focus on the value enhancement of fungible tokens can lead to short-termism and may ignore ethical and governance issues.  

*(I've called this conceptual debt)*

> DAO developers are also subject to path dependencies that undermine the evolution of decentralised DAO designs. Organisational communication structures will invariably influence future designs. While groups of DAO developers certainly influence DAO designs with their collective assumptions about how their intended DAO users will engage with the DAO, the inherent structure and approach of a group of developers building a software solution typically has an even larger impact on DAO design. The collective reasoning process of DAO developers is based largely on their prior experiences with DAO software solutions, which form path dependencies.

### Reputation Based System

> Reputation-Based Internal Governance

> The use of reputation staking and voting metrics in the DAO of DAO’s internal governance design has key advantages over other decentralised voting mechanisms. The DAO of DAOs’s use of reputation voting has two key advantages over other decentralised one-token-one-vote voting mechanisms:

> 1) it is non-fungible which avoids corruptive elements, and  
> 
> 2) it optimally aligns incentives for DAO of DAOs members individually and at the same time aligns their incentives for the totality of the DAO of DAOs as an institution.

> Because reputation is non-fungible, and ideally anonymous, it is much harder for DAO of DAOs members and external participants to try to game the system to improve their own utility exclusively while hurting the common good of the DAO of DAOs.  

> The DAO of DAO’s non-fungible and fungible token governance design enables the incentivization of DAO of DAOs members with indirect economic gain. In the DAO of DAO’s bifurcated design with two disparate types of tokens, i.e., reputation tokens and reputation salary tokens, 1. the non-fungible reputation tokens give DAO of DAOs members voting rights, and 2. fungible reputation salary tokens allow DAO of DAOs members to earn a fungible salary in proportion to their non-fungible reputation tokens. DAO of DAOs members increase their non-fungible tokens by making valuable contributions to the DAO and participating consistently in DAO of DAOs voting pools. DAO of DAOs members get paid with a fungible algorithmic stable token that is pegged to a pool of fungible tokens/good/consumer price index. The salary payments in fungible stable tokens are in proportion to DAO of DAOs members’ respective non-fungible reputation token scores. The indirect economic effects remove corruptive elements and
make the governance design more attack-resistant and stable in the long run.

> Reputation as a valuation metric allows DAO of DAOs members to improve their own utility while at the same time improving the DAO of DAOs in the long term. Because reputation is used as a metric for indirect economic benefits, i.e., a salary in fungible tokens that is paid in proportion of the non-fungible reputation token score, DAO of DAOs reputation token holders are incentivised to increase their own reputation/utility by engaging in valuable conduct for the DAO. The more the aggregated individual reputation of all DAO of DAOs members increases, the more the overall DAO of DAOs value increases, and the more the DAO of DAOs creates value enhancing outcomes for its members.

As far as I understand: The proposed bifurcated reputation-based system design  ("Reputation-Based Internal Governance"), allows the DAO to operate such that one may leverage 'pay-outs' of "fungible reputation salary tokens" against their (non-fungible) reputation tokens (gained through contributing).

> Suboptimal Incentive Design: The lack of decentralized governance solutions affects the application of decentralized systems on multiple levels. Decentralized networks depend on dynamic governance. As blockchains protocols evolve in a given market, they require updates. At the beginning of the 2020s, basic standards for the governance of digital assets were still missing. Efforts to provide more legal certainty through regulatory carve-outs were mostly tentative and lacked sufficient regulatory support or voting majorities in the regulatory agencies. The evolution of the digital asset market necessitates certainty for market participants. Without standards and governance, certainty and the associated market confidence cannot develop.

More legal certainty in the context of the jurisdiction's legal framework? Is that even a design consideration when it comes to constrained optimisation? I suppose geographical location of any registered legal wrapper?

**The Duality of Incentives**

TLDR: A game-theoretic model that rewards the contribution of the individual by rewarding the collective, plus a weighted value directly to the contributor based on merit and in proportion to the value of the overall system.
