### Notes on A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) of DAOs

*Not Yet Complete, [See Here](#bottom).*

> "Additional use cases of DAOs include financial transactions, secure voting, autonomous organizations, company management, freedom of speech networks, online games, crowdfunding, and speculation, among many other possible applications that cannot be foreseen."

Good to reference to provide use cases to newcomers.

> "Other networks are developing upgrades to blockchains that enhance smart contracting and associated DAO features."

Although 'other networks' are not specified, anybody coming from the ETH platform will likely be concerned with the platforms long term viability. Information for more 'serious inidividuals' could be provided (as well as used for marketing materials) regarding the advantages of using an eUTxO chain for dApp development, or simply for dApp usage (gas fees, etc). Using this quote as a reference highlights the requirement to migrate from ETH.

See the following quote:

> "The limitations of the Ethereum platform, such as transaction throughput and gas fees, are creating a need for next generation blockchain technology and smart contracts. DAOs help facilitate this evolution."

Welcome, ADAO, right?

> "The concept of a DAO fails if it becomes centralized. Centralization is omnipresent in computing systems, economics, and society at large. Yet centralization in governance is perhaps the largest threat to a DAO. With increasing centralization comes increasing risk of an organization's unifying principles changing or being ignored over time. Decentralization forces the shared understanding and shared social contract to be of primary importance for the life of the organization."

This does highlight the importance of decentralisation, however, it is quite abstract in its nature. Perhaps a concrete example may help? For instance:

In addition, something a little more related to finance, during the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis, internal audits at AIG were con

> "In 2007, AIG's auditors raised warnings. One of them, Joseph St.Denis, resigned in protest after Cassano repeatedly blocked him from investigating AIGFP's accounting."

It should be theoretically impossible to block the auditing (supervision) of DAOs:

> "Community audits are a key element in DAO governance. Centralized systems rarely provide for and administer community-driven audits. Community-driven audits go against the agency and monitoring principles embedded in the centralized governance."

One thought I have is: "who watches the watchman?" — hypothetically could an audit DAO be convinsed to provide 'AAA'-esque audit ratings to code in one form or another?

> "Tying the legal existence of a DAO to any forms of existing legal and jurisdictional frameworks typically results in the need for a representative in the chosen legal framework and jurisdiction, which, in turn, centralizes the DAO and results in the failure of the DAO concept."

Given that legal frameworks exist in all jurisdictions, assuming this statement holds true, how exactly is one suppose to effectively become a DAO & maintain decentralisation?

Some great quotes to come, but I will play devils advocate.

> "With only a limited ability to influence the direction of product/technology development, the developer community is less able to deploy its unique talents and skills in creating technology solutions for the greater good of humanity."

> "In other words, if the developer community does not receive the support it needs in developing decentralized infrastructure solutions, society at large suffers."

Motivation for asking this question is based on instances of so-called ‘exit-scams’ where an exchange (or some organisation) such as Intersango[1] or Mt.Gox[2] has (through malicious intent or otherwise) lost all of, or part of their organisations ‘treasury’. It’s either been stolen (purposefully) or has been lost through incompetence. Furthermore, we’ve seen similar behaviour at a collective level within much larger organisations (during 2007 — 2008 financial crisis) — financial institutions, rating agencies, governments, insurance companies, etc. How likely (or possible) is it for corruption to occur within a DAO?

<hr />

**Thoughts, general notes:** Currently, we’re operating in a fairly unregulated space. In addition, assuming we believe that "if the developer community does not receive the support it needs in developing decentralized infrastructure solutions, society at large suffers", it could be argued that a similar sentiment was echoed by Larry Summers when commenting on 'Has Finance Made the World Riskier?'[3], which I think is, at minimum, an interesting comparison to draw. He was essentially fighting agaisnt what he (and others) thought was over-reaching legislation.

'Has Finance Made the World Riskier?' focuses on incentive structures, which happens to be a key component within any DAO. From the perspective of fiduciary responsibility, if an entity provides tools for another (possibly nefarious DAO, or DAOs that indends to switch from being collectively invested to personally invested) DAO and that DAO fails, where does the accountability (or legal guilt) lay?

*An example (bear in mind, this is my first week really diving fairly deep & learning about these structures, perhaps I have misunderstood some technical details):*

Let’s assume some DAO uses tooling provided by an entity and implements reputation based staking that utilises NFT-Based Reputation Identifiers as a means of weighting each vote cast (as appose to other voting based mechanisms, such as one token one vote). Given the set of DAO members, would it possible for a subset of those members to 'turn rogue', sell their Reputation Identifiers to a third party and cause a catastrophic failure of the DAO?

Is this possible given the design constraints that have been currently considered?

> "DAOs have the potential to form the foundation for technology development that serves the greater good of society."

Great quote, the next question raised by a newcomer is likely to be: 'why?'.

> "At the beginning of the 2020s, DAOs are still subject to significant limitations. Such limitations include path dependencies, regulatory uncertainty, lingering suboptimal incentive designs, public policy, as well as market, economic, and technical limitations, among others."

General question: how far have we come since 2020? Are we maintaining 'Conceptual Design Debt'?

**There is a lot of information on Regulatory Uncertainty - however, I am under the impression that some of the American laws regarding tax, etc - are pretty wild & I don't really know enough about them to comment.**

However, this is a consideration that has certainly been made.

> "Human nature and any effective machine derivatives of human engagements in institutional form require a duality of incentives in order to overcome attempts of rational and opportunistic internal and external constituents to game the governance design of a given DAO. The duality of incentives consists of a) incentives for actors to improve their own utility, while at the same time b) actors’ actions benefit the entirety of the institution and its constituents for the long run."

* The notion of 'duality of incentives' is really interesting.
* I consider (or interpret) this somewhat to translate to: Successful DAOs offer incentive structures which promote lifestyles of autonomy, self-mastery and collective purpose [4].
* I think this is a great 'sell' to anyone considering to join.
