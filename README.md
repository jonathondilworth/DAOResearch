### Findings of Interest

**Topics Covered (in some degree of detail)**

*Some of the more sociological aspects are my own thoughts/potential (currently unformed) hypothesises regarding the collective behaviour of humans within DAOs of varying sizes and purposes. The DAO of DAOs paper was VERY informative.*

* DAOs (in general)
* DAO Applications
* Maintaining Decentralisation
* The Importance of Decentralisation
* Encapsulation Within Legal Frameworks (Jurisdictions)
* Path Dependencies (Conceptual Design Debt)
* The Importance Of Appropriate Layer One Architecture
* Supervisory Considerations (Community Audits)
* Incentive Design
* Poor Incentive Design
* The Notion Of Duality Of Incentives
* Voting Mechanisms
* Reputation Staking
* Merit Identifiers (NFTs VS Weighted Keys)
* Game-Theoretic Model Design Considerations
* Attack Vectors
* Emergent Social Network Topologies Given DAO Purpose & Potential Effects / Implications On Voting In A Reputation Based System
* Sociological Models (Behavioural Modelling & Further Attack Vectors)

*Add a written up pseudo-literature review if there is time.*
