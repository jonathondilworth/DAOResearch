## Research on DAOs

*Performing a pseudo-academic literature review.*

<details>

<summary>**TODO**</summary>

* Make important (most appropriate notes) first.
* Read papers nine through thirteen.
* Make notes on all findings.
* Reference sociological and anthropological papers.
* Prepare notes and materials for Friday 22:00 UTC.
* Try and distribute some materials before hand.
* Scan in all annotated papers (there are more details within annotations).
* Review resources of interest in more depth.
* (OPTIONAL, not required by deadline) Prepare a pseudo-academic written literature review.
* Note: oppurtunities for further research.
* Prepare for meeting Saturday evening UTC 6PM.

</details>

**Timeframe:** 
 
* Initial deadline Friday afternoon UTC.  
* Extended deadline for further research: Saturday evening UTC 6PM.

### Findings of Interest

<span id="topics"></span>

**Topics Covered (in some degree of detail)**

*Some of the more sociological aspects are my own thoughts/potential (currently unformed) hypothesises regarding the collective behaviour of humans within DAOs of varying sizes and purposes. The DAO of DAOs paper was VERY informative.*

* DAOs (in general)
* DAO Applications
* Maintaining Decentralisation
* The Importance of Decentralisation
* Encapsulation Within Legal Frameworks (Jurisdictions)
* Path Dependencies (Conceptual Design Debt)
* The Importance Of Appropriate Layer One Architecture
* Supervisory Considerations (Community Audits)
* Incentive Design
* Poor Incentive Design
* The Notion Of Duality Of Incentives
* Voting Mechanisms
* Reputation Staking
* Merit Identifiers (NFTs VS Weighted Keys)
* Game-Theoretic Model Design Considerations
* Attack Vectors
* Emergent Social Network Topologies Given DAO Purpose & Potential Effects / Implications On Voting In A Reputation Based System

### Quotes of Note, General Notes & Outline of Papers

<details>

<summary>**Tangibly understanding intangible complexities: Designing for distributed autonomous organizations**</summary>

>"DAOs introduce the principle that products and services may soon be owned and managed collectively and not by one person or authority, thus challenging traditional concepts of ownership and power."  

The above quote is a fairly nice, concise way to answer the question: 'What is a DAO?' or 'Why should I care about DAOs?' (for newcomers). It may lead to more questions, but I believe this would be benefitial, as we could then point the newcomer to educational resources and allow them to perform self-directed learning. If they become invested in the concept, they would likely join a DAO or potentially help further our collective aim.

> "For researchers and designers in areas of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Interaction Design to better understand and explore the implications of these emerging and future technologies as Distributed Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) we delivered a workshop at the ACM conference Designing Interactive Systems (DIS) in Edinburgh in 2017 (Nissen et al. 2017)."  

Emphasis on HCI.

> "The aim of this workshop was two-fold. First, to further understand, develop and critique these new forms of distributed power and ownership and second, to practically explore how to design interactive products and services that enable, challenge or disrupt existing and emerging models."  

Again, this quote could be modified to effectively convince newcomers to get involved, or continue to research DAOs.

> "We consider the term to refer to organizations and business models that are underpinned by smart contracts and distributed ledgers, operating somewhat autonomously. These novel technologies mean that concepts of value and value exchange are being challenged in a variety of ways, and, far from being neutral, these innovations are entangled with and are co-producing novel political, economic, social and material arrangements (Kinsley 2014), raising questions of ethics, privacy and the socio-political implications of new forms of distributed authority."  

Further information for individuals with a better understanding of distributed ledgers and blockchain protocols, but have not yet encountered DAOs?

> "The emergence of DAOs raises questions in many areas, inviting us to rethink current practices of ownership, value and ethical relationships and to reconsider 'value constellations' (Speed and Maxwell 2015) not as independent businesses but entangled networks of people, services and things."  

Another nice quote for newcomers.

> 'The main purpose of the workshop was to deepen our presently limited understanding of this rapidly emerging technology to understand better what DAOs are.'  

Key Topics:

1. Defining and designing for DAOs
2. Ownership, power and governance
3. Agency, materiality and politics

> "The fact that DAOs are autonomous (and, we will also question what ‘autonomous’ means in this context) raises questions of responsibility, ownership and power, in particular, what kinds of power relations do DAOs embody and reproduce, and what changes in conventional power relations are brought about by peer-to-peer, autonomous exchange."  

Note: DAOs as 'Complex Systems' is mentioned. I am curious as to whether the term is describing these systems as systems with emergent properties, or simply 'complicated systems'.

> "Questions emerging from the discussions in this group were focusing on
challenges in relation to the interoperability of a DAO between things, people and organizations and the potential possibilities that could allow for more connected ethical '[applications]' supply chains"

> "Concerns and issues relating to governance models were heavily debated asking where the power of a DAO may be in the cooperative model and if we as HCI designers and researchers have the skills to design a balance of power."

> "In other words, how do we design for resolving conflict with the structures of a distributed autonomous system? What rules and structures need to be programmed into a system and who programmes such decisions?"

There seems to be a fairly serious requirement for careful design considerations. This has been voiced as public sentiment (I believe), in addition to having been mentioned within other papers which will also be commented on within this document.
