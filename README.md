## Research on DAOs

*Performing a pseudo-academic literature review.*

<details>

<summary><strong>TODO</strong></summary>

* Make important (most appropriate) notes first.
* Read remaining papers.
* Make notes on all findings.
* Reference sociological and anthropological papers.
* Prepare notes and materials for Friday 22:00 UTC.
* Try and distribute some materials before hand.
* Scan in all annotated papers (there are more details within annotations).
* Review resources of interest in more depth.
* (OPTIONAL, not required by deadline) Prepare a pseudo-academic written literature review.
* Note: oppurtunities for further research.
* Prepare for meeting Saturday evening UTC 6PM.

</details>

**Timeframe:** 
 
* Initial deadline Friday afternoon UTC.  
* Extended deadline for further research: Saturday evening UTC 6PM.

### Findings of Interest

<span id="topics"></span>

**Topics Covered (in some degree of detail)**

*Some of the more sociological aspects are my own thoughts/potential (currently unformed) hypothesises regarding the collective behaviour of humans within DAOs of varying sizes and purposes. The DAO of DAOs paper was VERY informative.*

* DAOs (in general)
* DAO Applications
* Maintaining Decentralisation
* The Importance of Decentralisation
* Encapsulation Within Legal Frameworks (Jurisdictions)
* Path Dependencies (Conceptual Design Debt)
* The Importance Of Appropriate Layer One Architecture
* Supervisory Considerations (Community Audits)
* Incentive Design
* Poor Incentive Design
* The Notion Of Duality Of Incentives
* Voting Mechanisms
* Reputation Staking
* Merit Identifiers (NFTs VS Weighted Keys)
* Game-Theoretic Model Design Considerations
* Attack Vectors
* Emergent Social Network Topologies Given DAO Purpose & Potential Effects / Implications On Voting In A Reputation Based System
* Sociological Models (Behavioural Modelling & Further Attack Vectors)

*Add a written up pseudo-literature review if there is time.*
