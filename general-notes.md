### There are rather a lot of resources, but here it goes.

*Not at all proofread, essentially free association.*

"Tokens give communities superpowers."

Please explain.

Friends With Benefits DAO (Requires 75 Tokens for membership), then you can access a Discord server. TLDR: Token Gating, ownership in the community. Seems kind of cultural.

Authors note: I don't like the idea of being able to pay for governance (even if additional token votes are weighted using a quadratic function. When considering DAO incentive structures for proposal and voting policies, it would seem that the DAO mechanisms that generate a threshold for proposal acceptance must take into consideration the number of members, the number of engaged members, the DAOs social network topology and co-responding clustering coefficients to detect and effectively avilivate centralised or highly clustered nodes at the social level, as it could be hypothesized that a high degree of social clustering may be representative of a larger degree of centralised power. Furthermore, large-scale DAOs may be vulnerable to Sybil attacks, this would effectively render quadratic voting useless without a gating mechanism, but that gating mechanism should be based on the requirements of the DAO, and the alignment of incentives between the DAO and the individual + potentially a nominal fee for entrance.

This is why I thought it would be important to have DAOs that have social and technical interfaces thereby creating a network of DAOs that share an average (of similar scale) cardinality of the set of members.

If you can effectively interface between DAOs such that the number of members within each DAO is kept to an appropriate size, it would seem to me to be the case that the complexity of each item within the set of threat models can be significantly reduced.

Quote on purchasing governance:

"You think all segments of American society have equal and fair access to the system? You can walk into any hearing room you like, yes. One can walk into any hearing room, one can not necessarily write the kind of lobbying cheques that your industry writes, or engage in the level of political contributions that your industry engages in."

PartyDAO: Bid against whales, probably want to fractionalize the NFT. Again, this raises concerns for me. We're in a fairly unregulated space and money laundering does occur, washing NFTs to hyperinflate their value DOES OCCUR, all kinds of shady **** could go on with something like this.

An example: consider putting 10k USD into the creation of an NFT + a marketing campaign. You trade that NFT between a number of parties and inflate its value to 100k USD. You anticipate (or somehow encourage through a social trojan horse) that some partyDAO goes and bids against you on your own NFT. Is it not obviously apparent that so many conflicts of interest could be occurring within this space?!

Social Tokens: Token Gating (Fungible or NFTs, ERC-20 or ERC-721), offers access to a private community (devil's advocate: the proliferation of echo-chamber like behaviour? A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. This is why I don't go on Facebook very much because I know machine learning algorithms are going to just show me what I want to see. Similarly, if you're in an organisation where everyone shares similar values, you're simply reinforcing your potentially questionable values; like attracts like, and although this would seem to me to be a 'fun' idea, what effects could this have at a societal level? The emergence of cult-like behaviour, maybe?

Creator Tokens evolve into Community Tokens, sometimes, apparently.

Content DAOs seem to make sense to me.

Social Tokens are different to Governance Tokens. Governance managing large amounts of money.

Social tokens are more grassroots, they transition into governance tokens when serious decisions are required to be made.

The alignment of incentives between the individual and the collective is important. This is brought up in DAO of DAOs and is coined as Duality Of Incentives. This is integral to maintaining the integrity of the organisation, which is why I have expressed concerns with, for example, grouping securities together and creating financial derivative products whose value is tied to the underlying securities. This may topple the Duality Of Incentives, as shorting a DAO or a set of DAOs that a small, socially organised group participate in actively works against the duality of incentives.

DAO  
- Usually flat, and fully democratized.  
- Voting required by members for any changes to be implemented.  
- Votes tallied, and outcome implemented automatically without trusted intermediary.  
- Services offered are handled automatically in a decentralized manner (for example distribution of philanthropic funds).  
- All activity is transparent and fully public.
