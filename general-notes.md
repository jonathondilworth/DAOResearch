#### Jess Sloss (Seed Club) Presents at DAOs: Disrupting With Code - August'21

"Tokens give communities superpowers."

Please explain.

Friends With Benefits DAO (Requires 75 Tokens for membership), then you can access a Discord server. TLDR: Token Gating, ownership in the community. Seems kind of cultural.

Authors note: I don't like the idea of being able to pay for governance, even if additional token votes are weighted using a quadratic function. When considering DAO incentive structures for proposal and voting policies, it would seem that the DAO mechanisms that generate a threshold for proposal acceptance must take into consideration the number of members, the number of engaged members, the DAOs social network topology and co-responding clustering coefficients to detect and effectively avilivate centralised or highly clustered nodes at the social level, as it could be hypothesized that a high degree of social clustering may be representative of a larger degree of centralised power. Furthermore, large-scale DAOs may be vulnerable to Sybil attacks, this would effectively render quadratic voting useless without a gating mechanism, but that gating mechanism should be based on the requirements of the DAO, and the alignment of incentives between the DAO and the individual + potentially a nominal fee for entrance.

This is why I thought it would be important to have DAOs that have social and technical interfaces thereby creating a network of DAOs that share an average (of similar scale) cardinality of the set of members.

If you can effectively interface between DAOs such that the number of members within each DAO is kept to an appropriate size, it would seem to me to be the case that the complexity of each item within the set of threat models can be significantly reduced.

Quote on purchasing governance:

"You think all segments of American society have equal and fair access to the system? You can walk into any hearing room you like, yes. One can walk into any hearing room, one can not necessarily write the kind of lobbying cheques that your industry writes, or engage in the level of political contributions that your industry engages in."

PartyDAO: Bid against whales, probably want to fractionalize the NFT. Again, this raises concerns for me. We're in a fairly unregulated space and money laundering does occur, washing NFTs to hyperinflate their value DOES OCCUR, all kinds of shady **** could go on with something like this.

An example: consider putting 10k USD into the creation of an NFT + a marketing campaign. You trade that NFT between a number of parties and inflate its value to 100k USD. You anticipate (or somehow encourage through a social trojan horse) that some partyDAO goes and bids against you on your own NFT. Is it not obviously apparent that so many conflicts of interest could be occurring within this space?!

#### COOPER TURLEY of Seed Club, on Valuing Social Tokens

Social Tokens: Token Gating (Fungible or NFTs, ERC-20 or ERC-721), offers access to a private community (devil's advocate: the proliferation of echo-chamber like behaviour? A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. This is why I don't go on Facebook very much because I know machine learning algorithms are going to just show me what I want to see. Similarly, if you're in an organisation where everyone shares similar values, you're simply reinforcing your potentially questionable values; like attracts like, and although this would seem to me to be a 'fun' idea, what effects could this have at a societal level? The emergence of cult-like behaviour, maybe?

Creator Tokens evolve into Community Tokens, sometimes, apparently.

Content DAOs seem to make sense to me.

Social Tokens are different to Governance Tokens. Governance managing large amounts of money.

Social tokens are more grassroots, they transition into governance tokens when serious decisions are required to be made.

The alignment of incentives between the individual and the collective is important. This is brought up in DAO of DAOs and is coined as Duality Of Incentives. This is integral to maintaining the integrity of the organisation, which is why I have expressed concerns with, for example, grouping securities together and creating financial derivative products whose value is tied to the underlying securities. This may topple the Duality Of Incentives, as shorting a DAO or a set of DAOs that a small, socially organised group participate in actively works against the duality of incentives.

"Maybe it doesn't make sense to have one threshold for everything, maybe it makes sense to segment that out."

I am not too sure whether this is laughable or not. The community decides on the various 'access levels' for members, essentially creating a hierarchy within the DAO, where you're essentially creating a divide, a sense of status and potentially a large degree of variance in 'wealth' distribution, where wealth is a function of whatever that community considers to be valuable. Consider the legacy system that exists today. We nominate candidates (somewhat similar to access levels), then vote on who gets into power (a natural threshold), whilst it is not clear how the degree of power is distributed, I would assume that the higher 'access levels' have a larger degree of governance. Thus, replicating the governance system that already exists. Sure, use the legacy system for your social club, cool, but we're not getting much closer to making a positive shift in the world, in fact, we're encouraging the requirement for continued effort insofar as social mobility is concerned. By recreating what we already use (social protocols which can be considered as legacy) and utilising them for the purposes of something less serious than governance of people still re-inforces the values of legacy systems. I have no problem with this personally, but I would be somewhat worried insofar as 'herd mentality' is concerned.

Insofar as voting is not required for everything & allowing small working groups to contribute without going through the voting process, consider the following:

> "In CVS you never ever commit (because branches are SO PAINFUL) until it passes every single test! Then at your company, you have a strict committing rule that says: YOU WILL NEVER EVER COMMIT UNTIL IT HAS PASSED THE WHOLE TEST SUITE. Oh, and by the way, the fact that the test suite takes two hours to run is tough. **You can not afford to commit.** [...] and then in practice, people make one-liner changes and ignore the test suite because they know that one-liner changes CAN'T POSSIBLY BREAK THE SYSTEM."  
>- Linus Torvalds, Talk at Google on Git

I would like to point out that there is a correlation to be drawn here. However, the affordability of making a change without having it passed through voting shifts the entirety of accountability over to the individual rather than the organisation. This is simply a design decision. Do you trust that individual enough to never, ever make a mistake? Can small working groups afford to make their own decisions? What happens if small working groups do things people don't like using money from the treasury? Again, devil's advocate: it seems as though voting needs to be streamlined when it comes to smaller, simpler decisions, but it still needs to be there; otherwise the organisation will incur inconsistent accountability that could lead to issues. If organisations are not careful, this type of behaviour could result in the DAO failing.

The more this guy talks about social exclusivity based on token holdings (token gating) that correlate to individual wealth, I cannot help but continue to disagree with these principles, I won't make any further comments publicly.

This conversation is seated far too deeply in the notion of economic self-interest.

#### CEO's and Experts Hold Q&A Session at DAOs: Disrupting With Code 2021

FlamingoDAO has a maximum of 99 members.

realEstateDAO (housing DAO) - nobody really knows what is happening (exciting, right? Until you find yourself in the middle of a lawsuit).

DAOs generally share knowledge, no one knows what's going on.

ANON / PSEUDO-ANON DAOs. You probably want to be able to remain anonymous due to lack of regulation, but we require reputation-based mechanisms. It's difficult to put faith in a project when the creators are all anonymous, I feel, at least that it affects the credibility of a project.

*Try & get this finished up tomorrow.*

> TCT — 11/10/2021  
DAO  
- Usually flat, and fully democratized.  
- Voting required by members for any changes to be implemented.  
- Votes tallied, and outcome implemented automatically without trusted intermediary.  
- Services offered are handled automatically in a decentralized manner (for example distribution of philanthropic funds).  
- All activity is transparent and fully public.
