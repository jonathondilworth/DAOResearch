#### Jess Sloss (Seed Club) Presents at DAOs: Disrupting With Code - August'21

* "Tokens give communities superpowers."

*Authors Note: Please explain.*

* Friends With Benefits DAO (Requires 75 Tokens for membership), then you can access a Discord server. TLDR: Token Gating, ownership in the community. Seems kind of cultural.

* Authors note: I don't like the idea of being able to pay for governance, even if additional token votes are weighted using a quadratic function. When considering DAO incentive structures for proposal and voting policies, it would seem that the DAO mechanisms that generate a threshold for proposal acceptance must take into consideration the number of members, the number of engaged members, the DAOs social network topology and co-responding clustering coefficients to detect and effectively avilivate centralised or highly clustered nodes at the social level, as it could be hypothesized that a high degree of social clustering may be representative of a larger degree of centralised power. Furthermore, large-scale DAOs may be vulnerable to Sybil attacks, this would effectively render quadratic voting useless without a gating mechanism, but that gating mechanism should be based on the requirements of the DAO, and the alignment of incentives between the DAO and the individual + potentially a nominal fee for entrance.

* This is why I thought it would be important to have DAOs that have social and technical interfaces thereby creating a network of DAOs that share an average (of similar scale) cardinality of the set of members.

* If you can effectively interface between DAOs such that the number of members within each DAO is kept to an appropriate size, it would seem to me to be the case that the complexity of each item within the set of threat models can be significantly reduced.

> Quote on purchasing governance:  

> "You think all segments of American society have equal and fair access to the system? You can walk into any hearing room you like, yes. One can walk into any hearing room, one can not necessarily write the kind of lobbying cheques that your industry writes, or engage in the level of political contributions that your industry engages in."

* PartyDAO: Bid against whales, probably want to fractionalize the NFT. Again, this raises concerns for me. We're in a fairly unregulated space and money laundering does occur, washing NFTs to hyperinflate their value DOES OCCUR, all kinds of shady **** could go on with something like this.

* An example: consider putting 10k USD into the creation of an NFT + a marketing campaign. You trade that NFT between a number of parties and inflate its value to 100k USD. You anticipate (or somehow encourage through a social trojan horse) that some partyDAO goes and bids against you on your own NFT. Is it not obviously apparent that so many conflicts of interest could be occurring within this space?!

#### COOPER TURLEY of Seed Club, on Valuing Social Tokens

* Social Tokens: Token Gating (Fungible or NFTs, ERC-20 or ERC-721), offers access to a private community (devil's advocate: the proliferation of echo-chamber like behaviour? A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. This is why I don't go on Facebook very much because I know machine learning algorithms are going to just show me what I want to see. Similarly, if you're in an organisation where everyone shares similar values, you're simply reinforcing your potentially questionable values; like attracts like, and although this would seem to me to be a 'fun' idea, what effects could this have at a societal level? The emergence of cult-like behaviour, maybe?

* Creator Tokens evolve into Community Tokens, sometimes, apparently.

* Content DAOs seem to make sense to me.

* Social Tokens are different to Governance Tokens. Governance managing large amounts of money.

* Social tokens are more grassroots, they transition into governance tokens when serious decisions are required to be made.

* The alignment of incentives between the individual and the collective is important. This is brought up in DAO of DAOs and is coined as Duality Of Incentives. This is integral to maintaining the integrity of the organisation, which is why I have expressed concerns with, for example, grouping securities together and creating financial derivative products whose value is tied to the underlying securities. This may topple the Duality Of Incentives, as shorting a DAO or a set of DAOs that a small, socially organised group participate in actively works against the duality of incentives.

* "Maybe it doesn't make sense to have one threshold for everything, maybe it makes sense to segment that out."

* I am not too sure whether this is laughable or not. The community decides on the various 'access levels' for members, essentially creating a hierarchy within the DAO, where you're essentially creating a divide, a sense of status and potentially a large degree of variance in 'wealth' distribution, where wealth is a function of whatever that community considers to be valuable. Consider the legacy system that exists today. We nominate candidates (somewhat similar to access levels), then vote on who gets into power (a natural threshold), whilst it is not clear how the degree of power is distributed, I would assume that the higher 'access levels' have a larger degree of governance. Thus, replicating the governance system that already exists. Sure, use the legacy system for your social club, cool, but we're not getting much closer to making a positive shift in the world, in fact, we're encouraging the requirement for continued effort insofar as social mobility is concerned. By recreating what we already use (social protocols which can be considered as legacy) and utilising them for the purposes of something less serious than governance of people still re-inforces the values of legacy systems. I have no problem with this personally, but I would be somewhat worried insofar as 'herd mentality' is concerned.

* Insofar as voting is not required for everything & allowing small working groups to contribute without going through the voting process, consider the following:

> "In CVS you never ever commit (because branches are SO PAINFUL) until it passes every single test! Then at your company, you have a strict committing rule that says: YOU WILL NEVER EVER COMMIT UNTIL IT HAS PASSED THE WHOLE TEST SUITE. Oh, and by the way, the fact that the test suite takes two hours to run is tough. **You can not afford to commit.** [...] and then in practice, people make one-liner changes and ignore the test suite because they know that one-liner changes CAN'T POSSIBLY BREAK THE SYSTEM."  
>- Linus Torvalds, Talk at Google on Git

* I would like to point out that there is a correlation to be drawn here. However, the affordability of making a change without having it passed through voting shifts the entirety of accountability over to the individual rather than the organisation. This is simply a design decision. Do you trust that individual enough to never, ever make a mistake? Can small working groups afford to make their own decisions? What happens if small working groups do things people don't like using money from the treasury? Again, devil's advocate: it seems as though voting needs to be streamlined when it comes to smaller, simpler decisions, but it still needs to be there; otherwise the organisation will incur inconsistent accountability that could lead to issues. If organisations are not careful, this type of behaviour could result in the DAO failing.

* The more this guy talks about social exclusivity based on token holdings (token gating) that correlate to individual wealth, I cannot help but continue to disagree with these principles, I won't make any further comments publicly.

* This conversation is seated far too deeply in the notion of economic self-interest.

#### CEO's and Experts Hold Q&A Session at DAOs: Disrupting With Code 2021

* FlamingoDAO has a maximum of 99 members.

* realEstateDAO (housing DAO) - nobody really knows what is happening (exciting, right? Until you find yourself in the middle of a lawsuit).

* DAOs generally share knowledge, no one knows what's going on.

* ANON / PSEUDO-ANON DAOs. You probably want to be able to remain anonymous due to lack of regulation, but we require reputation-based mechanisms. It's difficult to put faith in a project when the creators are all anonymous, I feel, at least that it affects the credibility of a project.

#### Mint Season 1 episode 8

> Mint Season 1 episode 8 features Cooper Turley is actively shaping the Creator Economy through projects like Audius, Friends with Benefits, and PleasrDAO. He advises Variant as an operator and investor and works with teams on token launches and governance through Fire Eyes DAO.  

> On this episode, we talk about his recent article mapping out the current DAO landscape. With 100s of DAOs in existence, he argues which ones he thinks will outpace the test of time, his point of view on how crypto is revolutionizing the music industry, why he’s betting big on DAOs, and so much more.  

> I hope you enjoy our conversation.

* Web3

* CoinVice - Personal / Community social token.  Incentives, Token Rewards and Bounties and NFT business models. Discord Based.

* POAP - Proof-of-Attendance Protocol - NFT Tech - Life Diary - Minting NFTs for Meaningful Events - Crypto Native Communities - Adam Levy.

* Copper T - Pleasure DAO - Friends with Benefits - Fire Ice DAO - Mapping out the current DAO landscape - Crypto + Music Industry.

* Copper T - Music Industry Guy, DJing (HIGHLY SPECULATIVE & premature judge of character: good to know, I know a lot of DJs and Artists, producers have a serious gripe with the music industry and how unfair it can be in terms of remuneration, DJs GENERALLY, from my experience, tend to carry somewhat of an ego, I can understand why as I have played out myself on multiple occasions and it does come with this element of 'everybody wants to be your friend' and 'everybody wants you to go to an afterparty' - etc), speaker got into crypto to make a name for himself and to start building the creator economy.

* Marketing, Strategy, Business Development, Point People In The Right Direction, 'Get Shit Done'.

* Information on the music industry, smart contracts to cut out middle guys, DAOs make sense.

* Covering the DAO landscape article (TODO: FIND THIS ARTICLE).

* Working in the DAO space for 2 - 3 years, 3 - 5 months a lot more traction.

* Copper, a lot of things (RAC, Audius, Many Organisations).

* How do you find the time to manage everything? Lot's of FO-MO in crypto, how do you manage your time: living life, crypto and being a human.

*Authors note: I am literally wearing a T-Shirt that says FO-MO and provides a definition (in case anyone would like one, DM me, I'll send you one). Time management if done most effectively (in my opinion) by maintaining a regular routine or schedule (although difficult when working in different time zones). Replacing cooking meals with meal replacement (I consume one 'physical' meal per day and two replacement HUEL meals per day). I try my best to get at least six hours of sleep, preferably eight; and I put one day per week to one side for social interaction outside of libraries, my home office and my actual office.*

*Authors note, OFF-TOPIC: somewhat depressing when I hear people say I got into this during 2017/2018. I was born just a little too late, literally witnessing BTC moving from 3 USD to 7 USD in the space of two days, but being so young that 100 USD was a lot of money to me (14-ish years old?)*

* Paraphrased: 'DAOs contain members, members have roles. Operators - community manager on steroids.'

> Quote of note:  

> "There are so many people across so many working groups across any given DAO that it can be difficult to know what everyone else is working on, so having one given person who acts as the touch-point to really organise everything and keep everyone in check is probably one of the most valuable roles that a DAO has to offer today."

*Authors note: Look, I am no authority in this space, I've been here for the best part of a couple of weeks. Nevertheless, it would seem to me to be the case that perhaps the lack in the use of tooling or education on such tooling is a problem for the speaker. The aforementioned tools are used by technical individuals all the time: Slack, GitHub, Trello, Jira, Other Atlassian products, shared CalDAV for shared calendars, the list GOES ON). More importantly, this is a problem that can be solved without having to delegate too much control to one 'community manager on steroids' (creating an element of centralisation). At the end of the day, yes it's a consideration for the DAO, how decentralised do they want to be? From an ethical, moral and technical perspective, the answer is quite clear, as decentralised as possible. A practical example: Consider the 'bus factor' - if Joe is responsible for being the community manager on steroids, but tragically gets hit by a bus during either DAO development or simply during DAO maintenance, your organisation has a fairly serious problem. Furthermore, people experience the world as a function of phenomenal consciousness; and with it comes emotions and biases. Through the elimination of those elements by implementing code and effective tooling, you reduce the 'bus factor' to (effectively) zero. Finally, your uptime should then be tending towards 100%.*

#### General Notes Summary

*Updated as we go along. EDIT: need to re-update.*

* On-chain voting (MakerDAO)
* Off-chain voting (MakerDAO)
* Web interface (MakerDAO)
* Signal Request (MakerDAO)
* (X)iP (improvement proposal)
* Parameters for setting threshold (on different types of proposals), step function or logistic function?
* The aforementioned Parameters can be modified.
* Modifying parameters is done through voting.
* Note: assuming mass adoption occurs, can we expect users to understand what various 'policies' (which I'm considering to mean domain-specific parameter groupings) will do? For instance, can you expect the average user to understand that modifying the potential significance of modifying particular parameters?
* Potential for social engineering if users are not experienced enough to understand the significance of their vote. 
* Method of streamlining voting: delegating (so, yes, actually you could pass your vote on to a delegate, which I would consider to be a working group). Until you remove your delegation, that working group would have its own internal voting mechanism. Performance of delegated votes should likely be measured. How exactly to do that?
* Reputation-based staking in democratic systems would appear to be a requirement. It's a metric that could be used to evaluate the reliability of delegates.

In my humble opinion, instead of measuring 'strength of membership' through token holdings, 'it' should be measured through reputation and contribution (meritocracy).

- Voting required by members for any changes to be implemented.  
- Votes tallied, and outcome implemented automatically without trusted intermediary.  
- Services offered are handled automatically in a decentralized manner (for example distribution of philanthropic funds).  
- All activity is transparent and fully public.
